# This is the IOS Client implementation for accessibility client. 


# Purpose

  A tool for submitting voice feedback on webpage design flaws for accessibility

# Target platform

  IOS.
  This app uses camera, so not recommended on simulator.
  It works on the ipad, but is mainly designed for iphones.
 
# Architecture

  This app relied on pages instrumented with QR code to designate the goal for submission.
  Once a QR code is scanned (or eqivalent text string typed in), the app allows for voice feedback transcription sent to Firebase backend

# Usage

  When the user opens the app, they can scan the QR directly with phone camera. After that, they are in submssion screen.
  going back one menu brings them again to QR scan to annotate another page.

# Testing without QR

  Try a few existing page codes - MPUZKX, MLZRFQ, NFRHMO.
